# Merge Sort Algorithm

This repo contains my implementation of the merge sort algorithm in JavaScript. Merge sort is a classic divide and conquer sorting technique that recursively splits an array into halves, sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves back together. The script includes a function that accepts an array and returns a new sorted array without mutating the original. I included comments to explain each step and optional console logs to trace the recursion. Feel free to run the code and experiment with sorting different datasets.
